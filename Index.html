                <p>Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. 
                    But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused. 
                    Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>

                        Dissect its brain! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Interesting. 
                        No, wait, the other thing: tedious. And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</p>

                    <p>This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me! 
                        Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? 
                        Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're also Santa Claus! Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony? 
                        Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly?
